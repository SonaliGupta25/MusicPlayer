# MusicPlayer

Firstly, I would like to introduce that in this project I have linked the 'Single-Playlist Screen' with the 'Home Screen' through images that are present 
in the very first section of the 'main' of the HomeScreen. So you can easily explore this.

I have attached the codes for the above mentioned screens separately to achieve convenience for the reader.

I have built the search dialog box in an innovative way, as it expands on hover to see it visually just hover over that and you will witness this yourself.
In the header section along with the search box, I have enclosed a favourite option, the music player icon, the profile image and an bell icon.

Bell icon also conatains the notification count to give it a more realistic look. Then comes the division of page into aside and main section.

HOME SCREEN
Aside section contains the Queuelist whereas the main section contains the objective contents of the page, constituting of the song images where I 
have used some transitions as per my knowledge, hope you like it.

There is a section of Latest releases, Popular Artists, Theme-based Songs , Latest English Songs, Latest Hindi Songs.

The main images(large size images at the top of main) there is a hidden scroll bar to it, so the reader can scrolll a virtual scrollbar and swipe across 
other images as well.

I have given some shadow effects to various images to improve thier appearance.

I have made an hover effect over the Latest English and Hindi Songs that showcases the "Play Button" on hovering.

The music player is also been placed, which is kept fixed at the bottom of page and does not over-shadow other elements of the webpage as I have 
set the value of its z-index higher than other sections.

Now as soon as you click on the song images placed very first in the main section, the single playlist screen will appear.

SINGLE PLAYLIST SCREEN
This screen also contains the header section, main section and aside section.
The header section is somehwhat similar to the homescreen only in order to maintain the basic template design.

The aside section now contains two parts: Similar Artists and Recently Played

The development of of these sub-parts is different from each other that will be visible in their codes.

The main section contains the currently played song image along with its description and other details.
You can hover over the 'Follow' keyword to see some basic effect.

I have used gradient in the Play All Button.

Then below this are tracks with other songs of the same band.
Just hover over these single tracks for a better experience. You can also hover over the heart & plus sign to see the effects. 

RESPONSIVE DESIGNS
I have enrolled some basic changes to it, like the layout is kept robust and easily understandable to the viewer, cluster free and organized.
Though on click features, will be enabled once we learn Javascript; the design and outlook are the two parts I worked upon.
